# Input the base and height of the triangle and convert it to a float
base = float(input("Enter the length of the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula
area = (base * height) / 2

# Print the result
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
